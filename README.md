1. This project incorporated CSS and HTML while using new learning like bootstrap.
2. A couple of things I did that are a best pratice is tried to make it as visually appealing as possible for the user. Secondly if a field was required and they did not insert something, I would alert them.
3. With clear labels and color patterns I was able to provide an easy to follow along with layout for all users. The keyboard navigation was also well put together to ensure that people who can not use a mouse or keyboard can still use the form. The tooltip is also utilized which gives more context to the field for users who may be confused. All of th enext and submit buttons are made to be clearly navigatable and allow for a user friendly experience.
